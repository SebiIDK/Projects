2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell led_reg[11]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) led_reg[11]/CLR, led_reg[5]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell led_reg[13]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) led_reg[13]/CLR, led_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell led_reg[15]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) led_reg[15]/CLR, led_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rst relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw[1] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw[2] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[11] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[11]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[13] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[13]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[15] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[15]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
